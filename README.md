Our program asks the user to input their name, followed
by a prompt to enter two numbers. The sum of those
numbers-along with a greeting-is then printed to the
output stream.

In order to install our software, the latest version of
python is required. After that, the program is very
simple to run and execute by using any Python compiler.
If using the command prompt, the user must cd into the
correct directory. From there the python file can be
executed, as long as all protocols of our licenses
page are followed Follow its prompts and you will soon
enough have the sum of two numbers.
`Enter a number:
 Enter another number: 
 Hi, \" + name + \"! The sum of your numbers is \" +
 sum`
